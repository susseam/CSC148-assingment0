    === Private Attributes ===
    _d: the date of this election.
    _ridings: all ridings for which any votes have been recorded in this
        election.
    _parties: all parties for which any votes have been recorded in this
        election.
    _results: the vote counts for this election.  Each key is the name of a
        riding, and its value is a dictionary of results for that one riding.
        Each of its keys, in turn, is the name of a party, and the associated
        value is the number of votes earned by that party in that riding.
            A party only appears in the dictionary for a riding if that party
        has had at least one vote recorded in that riding.

    === Representation Invariants ==
    - For all strings s, s in self._ridings iff s in self._results
    - For all strings s, s in self._parties iff s in self._results[r] for some r
    - All recorded vote counts are greater than 0. That is,
      for every key (riding, results) in self._results,
          for every (party, votes) in results,
